Getting and Cleaning Data Final Project
Christopher Yarnell

This readme describes the assignment. There are three associated files: 

1) run_analysis.r: contains the R code needed to run the assignment
2) README.md: contains descriptions of the code and steps taken to do the assignment.
3) Codebook.md: contains the step-by-step process used to transform the data into the requested tidy dataset of average measurements by activity by subject. Also includes a legend of variable names.

In order to read in the completed table at the end, use read.table("UCI HAR Dataset Averages-by-Subject.txt", header = TRUE)
